    CLIPListPy - Command Line Item Priorities List


    (IN DEVELOPMENT)
    CLIPListPy is a console application that is  essentially an 
    item tracker in which priority levels, estimated start and 
    completion dates, as well as actual start and completion 
    dates can be set for each item.

    CLIPListPy is written in Python, hence the "Py" at the end
    of the name.
